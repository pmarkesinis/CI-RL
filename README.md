Computational Intelligence - Reinforcement Learning 

During this project, I had the opportunity to collaborate with three colleagues in developing a self-navigating robot model for grocery shopping. 
Our main goal was to enable the robot to learn the most efficient way to navigate the supermarket. 
The supermarket was modeled as a maze, where reaching the target location would yield a reward. 
To achieve this, we adopted a reinforcement learning approach, specifically implementing Q-Learning in Python.
